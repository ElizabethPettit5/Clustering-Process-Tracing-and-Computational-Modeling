# Clustering-Process-Tracing-and-Computational-Modeling
Data and code used to analyze the manuscript "Using process tracing and computational modeling to investigate cognition during risky decision making"


All computational modeling for this experiment was complete using the toolbox created by Dr. Romain Ligneul (https://github.com/romainligneul/igt-toolbox). The data file can be found in the Computational Modeling branch and is named IGTdata.mat. Model fits can also be found in this branch.
